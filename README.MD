# Staxx
## A new social experience

Staxx is built on top of Lens. It is a React app, so `npm install` and `npm start` are your friends.

# Design

We’ve hacked together a minimum delightful product that makes web3 easy to understand and use for creatives and tastemakers alike. 

 - Physical metaphors have been proven to significantly help users understand product functionality and onboarding. Using Staxx— a reference to archives— as a recurring theme in our UX writing was an intentional design choice to help users understand how lens collections, referrals, and our app’s curated boards and feed all fit together to take ownership over their original works & help them find the inspiration they need to take their aesthetic and work to the next level. 
 - Helping the best projects find their ideal communities. Our curated boards are more than just digital archives— people can reply to them to comment on others curatorial abilities in addition to commenting on individual posts, contribute to public boards and vote out uploads for relevance. Creators can engage with broader movements in addition to their own communities and find their target audience more easily.
 - With every contribution recorded on chain, it is now possible to see which curators have the biggest impact on driving adoption of certain trends so they can get credit for their contributions / tastemaking.
 - True ownership over their work. Uploading a collection and opening it to curation is now as easy as uploading on a web2 app. We made minimal, seamless creator tools that make it easy for creators to present their work beautifully and have it collected, and see in real time the depth of engagement and influence between their work and their community
